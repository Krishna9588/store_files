        "Context": "Clay Magouyrk: Many customers today use multiple clouds. They might have something in AWS, something in Azure, something in Google, something on-premises. The goal is to make it easy for customers to use the cloud or clouds that best fit their particular workloads. That means bringing our services to where customers are already operating and providing them with greater options and flexibility. One example of this is the Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure, which provides low-latency access between Azure and OCI, allowing customers to use their existing Azure credits to consume OCI database services. We’re working on similar interoperability with other cloud providers, including AWS and Google Cloud. Journalist: What does that mean for customers? Magouyrk: The Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure is a great example of this thinking, because it makes it much easier for customers to consume OCI database services from within their Azure environment, using their existing Azure credits and with the simplicity of an Azure-like experience. While this partnership is unique in how tightly integrated it is, it fits within a bigger strategy. We know our customers have applications running across all major clouds—and they want to use the best services from each. So you might have applications running on AWS for the best serverless experience, on Azure for its AI services, and then need the best database from Oracle in OCI. We want to enable our customers to get exactly what they need, wherever they are.",
        "Usage Indicated": "No",
        "Explanation": "The analysis of the provided text reveals that Oracle's discussions around 'AWS' are consistently in the context of its customers using AWS or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) interoperating with AWS to serve these customers. Phrases such as 'Many customers today use multiple clouds. They might have something in AWS...' and 'We know our customers have applications running across all major clouds—and they want to use the best services from each. So you might have applications running on AWS...' describe a 'Third-Party Action' (customers using AWS) or Oracle's strategy to support customer choice across different cloud providers, rather than Oracle itself actively using, developing, or deploying AWS for its own operations. This explicitly triggers the 'Third-Party Action' exclusion rule.",
