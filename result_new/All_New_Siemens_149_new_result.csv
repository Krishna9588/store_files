1,oracle,http://www.oracle.com/cloud/,https://www.oracle.com/cloud/multicloud/clay-magouyrk-oracle-cloud-aws-google-azure/,AWS,Not Found,No,"The analysis of the provided text reveals that Oracle's discussions around 'AWS' are consistently in the context of its customers using AWS or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) interoperating with AWS to serve these customers. Phrases such as 'Many customers today use multiple clouds. They might have something in AWS...' and 'We know our customers have applications running across all major clouds—and they want to use the best services from each. So you might have applications running on AWS...' describe a 'Third-Party Action' (customers using AWS) or Oracle's strategy to support customer choice across different cloud providers, rather than Oracle itself actively using, developing, or deploying AWS for its own operations. This explicitly triggers the 'Third-Party Action' exclusion rule."
2,oracle,http://www.oracle.com/cloud/,https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/vmware/,Vmware,Not Found,Yes,"The text states, ""Oracle Cloud VMware Solution lets you migrate VMware-based workloads to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) without changes to applications or operations. Retain control with familiar VMware tools, while benefiting from OCI’s security, higher performance, and lower cost. Run VMware workloads in a cloud environment dedicated to your enterprise."" This indicates that Oracle has a product called ""Oracle Cloud VMware Solution"" that allows users to run VMware workloads on Oracle Cloud, meaning Oracle utilizes VMware technology. This meets the 'Product Integration' positive indicator."
3,oracle,http://www.oracle.com/cloud/,https://www.oracle.com/sap/,SAP,Not Found,No,"The text retrieved from the URL discusses Oracle's partnership with SAP, not Oracle's internal use of SAP, thus failing the 'Third-Party Action' exclusion rule. The relevant phrase is: ""Oracle and SAP: A Longstanding Partnership for Innovation."" "

This demonstrates Accenture is actively hiring for internal operational roles that require hands-on skills with 'linux', which meets the 'Active Job Roles' positive indicator."
