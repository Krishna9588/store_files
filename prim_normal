working
- input
- clean up of data
- temp db file set up and config file - header, api, models.
- start with html and pdf content extracting
- store then context into db
- after 10 to 15 sec - start gemini script
- lets first get result of both the prompts. (together append them into next file or db_file)
- after it's been done we will use our senior_analyst for best result with previous 2 results.
- once we got our result from senior_analyst we will compile all our result into final sheet.



# updates and changes
- we need to find alternative of gemini
- not an LLM but something else.

# note:
for internal process we will use .json of db files
for input and output we will use .csv or .json files
working should be isolated
