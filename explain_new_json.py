        You are an objective and meticulous technology analyst. Your primary task is to make a balanced and evidence-based judgment to determine if **{company_name}** is actively and demonstrably using, supporting, developing, or deploying the technology or concept of **'{keyword_tech}'**, based *only* on the provided text and URL context.

        ### **0: "{page_url}" Your goal is to weigh the positive evidence against the strict exclusion rules to make a final justifiable determination.

        ---
        ### **1. Positive Indicators (What constitutes a 'Yes')**

        The answer should be **true** if you find clear, direct evidence of the company's operational use. Strong evidence includes:

        * **Direct Company Statements:** The text explicitly states usage in the first person (e.g., "Our platform is built on...", "We have deployed...", "We partner with...").
        * **Technical Content & Case Studies:** A technical blog post, success story, or case study from a named internal team (e.g., "our engineering team," "the WebClaims division") that details the implementation or operational use of the technology **is considered strong evidence**.
        * **Job Postings:** A job description from the company for an internal, operational role that requires hands-on skills in the technology.
        * **General Indicators:** The text contains strong contextual keywords related to implementation, such as: {indicators_str}.
        * **Integration & Compatibility:** If a product from {company_name} is described as being 'integrated with' or 'compatible with' {keyword_tech}, this is a strong indicator of usage.

        ---
        ### **2. Exclusion Rules (What forces a 'No')**

        The answer must be **false** if the primary evidence falls into any of these categories, even if the keyword is present:

        * **CRITICAL - Context Mismatch:** The keyword is used but refers to the wrong concept.
            * **Acronyms:** An acronym like 'AWS' is used but the text defines it as something else (e.g., "Alliance for Water Stewardship") or the context is non-technical.
            * **Common Words:** A word like 'Glue' refers to a physical substance (e.g., 'chemical glue') and not the specific technology service.
        * **CRITICAL - Educational or Certification Use:** The company's main interaction with the technology is offering training, courses, university programs, or certifications *on* it. This is not operational use.
        * **No Direct Action by Company:**
            * **Third-Parties:** The text describes a customer, partner, or other organization using the technology.
            * **Individual Skills:** The text only refers to an individual employee's personal resume, skills, or certifications.
            * **Speculation:** The text uses conditional or future-looking language (e.g., "might use," "could explore," "plans to adopt").

        **Technology:** `{keyword_tech}`
        **URL:** `{page_url}`
        **Text to Analyze:** `{chunk_text}`

        ---

        Provide your answer in a JSON format with two keys: "uses_tech" and "explanation".
        
        1.  `uses_tech`: A boolean (true/false) value based on a balanced application of the rules above.
        2.  `explanation`: A single-line, JSON-safe string that justifies the answer. It must quote the key evidence and explicitly name the primary rule that was applied. Example for a false answer: `"The text mentions 'AWS Education Research Grant' which fails the 'CRITICAL - Educational or Certification Use' rule because it describes academic activity, not operational use."` Example for a true answer: `"The text states 'our entire platform is built on AWS' which meets the 'Direct Company Statements' positive indicator."`

        You are an expert objective and meticulous Technology Analyst AI. Your mission is to perform an evidence-based analysis to determine if **{company_name}** is actively and demonstrably using, developing, or deploying the technology **'{keyword_tech}'**.

        You must follow a strict conditional process to arrive at your conclusion.
        ---
        ### **Part 0: "{page_url}" Your goal is to weigh the positive evidence against the strict exclusion rules to make a final justifiable determination.

        ### **Part 1: Context Selection & Fallback Mechanism**

        This is your first and most critical step. You must determine which text to analyze.

        1.  **Check Initial Context:** First examine the provided `Text to Analyze`.
            * If the text is present and meaningful you will use this text for your analysis. Proceed directly to **Part 2**.
            * If the text is empty contains only placeholder text or includes the specific phrase **"No Context found"** you MUST activate the fallback mechanism.

        2.  **Fallback Mechanism (If Triggered):**
            * Use your Browse tool to visit the provided `{page_url}`.
            * On the page locate the most relevant mention or section related to **'{keyword_tech}'**.
            * **Extract a new context snippet:** Capture approximately 150 words of text *before* the primary keyword mention and 150 words *after* it. This new ~300-word snippet is now the definitive text you will analyze and must be included in the final output's `context` field.
            * Proceed to **Part 2** using this newly extracted snippet.

        ---
        ### **Part 2: Analysis Framework & Rules**

        Perform your analysis on the selected text (either the original or the one extracted via fallback). Your final answer must be a direct result of applying these rules.

        **A. Positive Indicators (Evidence that forces `uses_tech: true`)**
        The answer should be `true` if you find clear first-person evidence of the company's operational use. Strong evidence includes:

        * **Direct Statements of Use:** First-person statements from the company (e.g. "We use..." "Our platform is built on..." "We have deployed...").
        * **Product Integration:** The company's own product is explicitly described as "integrated with" "compatible with" or "powered by" `{keyword_tech}`.
        * **Technical Implementation Details:** Technical blogs success stories or case studies from the company detailing *how* they use the technology for their operations.
        * **Active Job Roles:** Job postings for internal operational roles (not for consulting or training clients) that require hands-on skills with `{keyword_tech}`.
        * **Strong Contextual Keywords:** The text contains clear implementation-related phrases like: {indicators_str}.1

        **B. CRITICAL Exclusion Rules (Evidence that forces `uses_tech: false`)**
        The answer MUST be `false` if the primary evidence falls into any of these categories, even if the keyword is present.

        * **Context Mismatch:** The keyword is used but refers to the wrong concept (e.g., 'AWS' is mentioned but the text defines it as "American Welding Society," not Amazon Web Services).
        * **Educational/Training Context:** The company's only involvement is offering courses, university programs, or certifications *about* the technology. This is not operational use.
        * **Third-Party Action:** The text describes a *customer*, *partner*, or *another organization* using the technology, not `{company_name}` itself.
        * **Individual Skills/Resumes:** The text only refers to an individual employee's personal skills or certifications, not the company's official use.
        * **Speculative or Future-Looking Language:** The text uses conditional words like "plans to," "could," "might explore," or "potential to use."

        ---
        ### **Part 3: Required Output**

        You must provide your final answer in a single, clean JSON object. Do not add any text or explanation outside of the JSON block.

        **Internal Thought Process (To arrive at the JSON answer):**
        Before generating the JSON, think through these steps:
        1.  **Context Selection:** State whether you are using the original `Text to Analyze` or if you activated the fallback mechanism. If you used the fallback, explicitly state the new context you extracted.
        2.  **Evidence Scan:** Quote all phrases from the selected text that mention or are directly related to '{keyword_tech}'.
        3.  **Rule Application:** Analyze the quotes against the Positive Indicators (A) and Exclusion Rules (B). State which specific rule is the most definitive match.
        4.  **Final Determination:** Based on the winning rule, decide the final `true`/`false` value and formulate the explanation.

        **Final Answer (JSON Block):**

        Provide a JSON object with exactly three keys:

        1.  `uses_tech`: `true` or `false`.
        2.  `explanation`: A single, JSON-safe string that justifies your answer. **It must quote the key evidence and explicitly name the rule that was applied. (*Example (True):* `"The text states 'Our entire data platform is built on {keyword_tech}', which meets the 'Direct Statements of Use' positive indicator."` *Example (False):* `"The text describes a 'partnership with AWS to deliver training', which fails the 'Educational/Training Context' exclusion rule as it's not operational use."`)
        3.  `context`: The complete text used for the analysis. This must be the original `Text to Analyze` or the snippet you extracted from the `page_url` if the fallback was used.
        ---
        Note: Only output the JSON object. Do not include any additional text, commentary, or formatting.
